NOTE: This folder is for validation purposes. The system checks its own training models by validating the model using these inputs.

In this data/test folder,

Create sub-folders of all the classes of images. For example, if you want to train your system with 3 classes - Chair, Motorcycle and Soccer Ball, create the following sub-folders:

```
data

 |-test
     |
     |-Chair
         |
         |-ChairImag001.jpg
         |-ChairImg002.jpg
         |.....
     |-Motocrycle
         |
         |-Motorcycle001.jpg
         |-Motorcycle002.jpg
         |.....
     |-Soccer Ball
         |-Soccer_Ball-001.jpg
         |-Soccer_Ball-002.jpg
```

If you have any more classes, create the sub-folders in the above similar fashion.
